### Fennec Rate ###

Benchmark risk free rate for stablecoins.
(USDT; other stablecoins TBA).  


The idea behind this project is to offer a high quality product, through a solid / simple to understand UI, 
where anyone can easily acess a risk free (more specifically a Delta free) interest 
rate in stablecoins like USDT, DAI, USDC, etc...

Any further development can be in the form of: 
  // A larger amount of markets (CEXs) where more interesting interest rates are attainable.
     (Where it's necesarry to know how to work with more API's BUT WILL ALSO BRING MORE MATURITIES).
     Ex: Kraken, Poloniex, Coinbase, Bitrex, Kucoin, bitfinex...
  // A larger display of available stablecoins.
  // Integration of other investment strategies (i.e. perpetual futures options).
